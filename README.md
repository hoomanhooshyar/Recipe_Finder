# Recipe_Finder
In this Project I use Jetack Compose, MVVM and Clean Architecture.
You can search and find food recipes base on https://www.themealdb.com
And absolutely you can watch the recipe in the App if there is a video on youtube for that.

Username and Password in this App are static because I didn't have any API for that.
But I use Proto DataStore for save logged in user.
